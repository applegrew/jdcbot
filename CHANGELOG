* Added org.elite.jdcbot.shareframework.ShareManagerListener
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.shareframework.UploadStreamManager
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.examples.DemoBot - This will be a full fledged client (which will have no 
	UI but will be controllable by another client). Its main purpose is to provide implementational
	guidelines for user of jDCBot
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.framework.BotInterface
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.framework.DownloadCentral
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.framework.GlobalObjects
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.framework.MultiHubsAdapter - To provide easy method to connect to multiple
	hubs
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.framework.UDPInputThread - To listen for UDP packets (which enclose the
	search results)

* Renamed org.elite.jdcbot.util.UploadEntityStream to org.elite.jdcbot.util.InputEntityStream
* Renamed org.elite.jdcbot.util.DownloadEntityStream to org.elite.jdcbot.util.OutputEntityStream
	(DownloadEntityStream still exists but it is deprecated and performs no function, it notifies
	the user about this change)
* Added org.elite.jdcbot.util.GlobalFunctions - It has some general purpose functions that is used
	by framework classes and could be used by users of jDCBot too.

* Hashing of files, adding and removing files/directories to share has been implemented in ShareManager
* ShareManager can now create XML bzip2 compressed file list
* Can now parse XML bzip2 compressed file lists and convert that into instance of FileListManager,
	which provides features like searching , quering and manipulating file lists. Manipulating
	downloaded file lists of other users is useless though

-- v1.0 2008-June-25 --
* Made many classes thread-safe. In javadoc of all such classes it has been clearly mentioned if
	they are thread safe. Non-thread safe classes have no such comment.
* Fixed bug in UserManager and User where username comparsions used case sensitive comparisions
	whereas DC protocol makes no such requirements, infact hubs seem to use case-insensitive
	comparisions.
* Added EventjDCBot (and two more accompaning classes for convinience and a listener interface). Its
	purpose is to generate events for listeners for events generated by jDCBot (which traditionally
	allows only its sub-class to listen for events).
* Changed the way setDirs should be called. Now it should be called in jDCBot or MultiHubsAdapter
	(if present) intead of directly calling setDirs of ShareManager and DownloadCentral.
* DownloadCentral is now easier and neater to use. Its bugs have been fixed which made it almost
	non-operational.
* Fixed various bugs in ShareManager, User, UserManager, DownloadHandler, DownloadManager,
	UploadHandler, TimeoutInputThread, DemoBot, and more.
* Created few methods meant to be overridden in ShareManager. See its javadoc for there purpose and
	DemoBot for ways to implement them.
* All event methdos in jDCBot (the ones whose names start with 'on' and are overridable) will now
	be run in jDCBot Dispatch Thread. (Previously only a handful ran in that thread.)

-- v1.0 2008-June-29 --
* Fixed more bugs and removed dead-locks. Hopefully they are all resolved.
* Replaced all use of Vector with ArrayList.
* Added more features into DemoBot.
