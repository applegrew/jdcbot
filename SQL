(Needed only if you want to use the example class StaticCommands.java, Other dependencies have been included)
You will need MySQLConnector, get it at http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/. Secondly, change database name, username and password for MySQL in StaticCommands.java, and finally, insert data from static.sql (we won't explain you how to that...sorry:(
